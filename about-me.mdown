  <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a 25 year old male, looking to transition from the restaurant industry into the tech industry. I don't currently have any hard technical skills, which is why I've decided to enroll in this course. My goal is to learn the fundamentals of programming to the extent that I can land a Junior Dev position for a tech company in SF.</p>

  <h1 class="heading">Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>Here is a list of the places I've lived (in chronological order): I was born and raised in San Mateo, California. I went to college in Santa Cruz, at UCSC. From there, I moved to Shanghai, where I helped manage my family's restaurant expansion into China. After Shanghai, I moved to San Diego to help manage a couple of my family's restaurants down there. From San Diego, I moved to San Francisco, where I am currently living, and focusing on learning computer programming.</p>

  <dl class="questions-section">
  <dt class="question">What music have you been listening to lately?</dt>
  <dd class="answer">I've been listening to my "Discover Weekly" playlist on Spotify. I discovered the band "Caught a Ghost" through this playlist, and have been listening to them quite a bit.</dd>
  <dt class="question">Do you listen to any podcasts? If so, which ones?</dt>
  <dd class="answer">There are a few podcasts I listen to regularly. My favorite podcast is "The Bill Simmons Podcast." I also enjoy Marc Maron's "WTF podcast." I used to listen to a lot of Grantland podcasts, before Grantland was disbanded, so I've filled that void with some Channel 33 Podcasts (Bill Simmons affiliated content). And recently, I started listening to Katie Nolan's "Garbage Time" podcast.</dd>
  <dt class="question">What are your favorite websites?</dt>
  <dd class="answer">I like to browse reddit when I'm bored and/or looking for light-hearted content. I like reading through posts on Quora when I come across an interesting topic, and want to learn something about said topic. I'm a big fan of movies and TV, so I spend a lot of time on Rotten Tomatoes to discover new/intersting movies and TV.</dd>
  <dt class="question">Have you watched any good TV shows or movies recently?</dt>
  <dd class="answer">I recently started watching Amazon's original TV series "Betas", which is quite good. As for movies, I watched "The Revenant" last week, which would be my pick for best picture of 2015.</dd>
